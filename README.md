Hello Everyone!  Welcome to my github!  My name is Harry, and yes I know I am late to this github party, but better late than never!
I'm trying to break into the world of IT, the Cybersecurity Sector, and since the competition is fierce out there I need to show what I am made of.


I love to learn new things, and I want to break into cybersecurity but so far I'm on the outside looking in, but that is subject to change.
I have certficiates in the following:


✅ CompTIA Security+

✅ CompTIA Network+

📜 Certification of Cybersecurity from Minnesota University

And last but not least Studying AZ-900, Linux and Splunk

I created this portfolio to showcase my future hands-on projects, labs, and write-ups as I try to further my career in the cybersecurity field.

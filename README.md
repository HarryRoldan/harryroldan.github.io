Hello Everyone!  Welcome to my github!  My name is Harry, and yes I know I am late to this github party, but better late than never!
I'm trying to break into the world of IT, the Cybersecurity Sector, and since the competition is fierce out there I need to show what I am made of.


I love to learn new things, and I want to break into cybersecurity but so far I'm on the outside looking in, but that is subject to change.
I have certficiates in the following:


‚úÖ CompTIA Security+

‚úÖ CompTIA Network+

üìú Certification of Cybersecurity from Minnesota University

And last but not least Studying AZ-900, Linux and Splunk

I created this portfolio to showcase my future hands-on projects, labs, and write-ups as I try to further my career in the cybersecurity field.

## üêß Linux Basics First Linux Lab (LabEx)

### Objective
Starting my Linux refresher journey.
Learned: echo, id, uid, gid, groups, apt, sudo, install

### What I did?
I started using Labex to start this journey, and so far the hands on labs have been useful.

### Learning id and echo

These two commands were a refresher for me.  As you can see from the picture below I used echo to repeat my input.  
<id> I used to see who the groups that I belonged to.  It was very basic, but it is something that is very important.

![Lab Screenshot](images/2.png)

below you will see the once I used the command <id> it showed  the 
<uid> which is the user ID 
<gid> Your primary group ID
<groups> All the groups that a user is a member of.

What good is this information if you don't know what it means?  So, I highlighted the uid, gid and groups area of the above image.  
And you can see the number 5000 after each portion.  So what does the number 5000 indicate or mean?  Well the number '0' indicates the user is the
root user, who has super privileges on the system and can do almost anything.  In most Linux systems numbers 1-999 are reserved for system accounts and 
services.  And numbers 1000-5000 are for regular users on the system. 

## üêß Second Linux Labs pwd, ls, and cd LabEx

In my second Lab I am refreshing with more basic commands.  I remembered all of them expcet one that I didn't learn.  So let us get started!
the first command is pwd (print working directory).  What this does is it shows the users current location within the system.  BUT there is one command that
I didn't know about and it was the ~ (tilde symbol).  This is a quick travel back to the users home directory, which I found out to be very neat!  Take a look at the image below!
